      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: June 19, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Paddez.com ("we", "us", or "our")
        handles information in connection with your use of our application,
        covering both data managed on your device (client-side) and data
        processed or stored on our servers to provide application features.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We strive to minimize the personal data we collect. This policy outlines
        how we handle information, including data stored on your device and data
        processed or temporarily stored on our servers to provide application
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Stored Locally on Your Device:</strong> (Covered in detail
        in 'Client-Side Storage').
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Processed or Stored on Our Servers:</strong> To provide
        core application functionality, such as fetching album information,
        enabling caching, and supporting the 'Share Your Grid' feature, certain
        data you provide or that is generated by your requests is processed and
        may be temporarily stored on our servers. This includes your Last.fm
        username (when provided), selected time periods for album charts,
        album/artist names (for lookups), and the generated album grids for
        sharing. We do not store personal identifiers like your name or email
        address unless you provide them directly (e.g., by contacting us via
        email).
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the analytics described in the 'Google Analytics' section and
        functional client-side storage, our application does not use traditional
        browser cookies for tracking your activity across other sites.
      </p>

      <h2>Client-Side Storage</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned in the "Information We Collect" section, some data is
        stored locally on your device. Our application utilizes your browser's
        <code>localStorage</code> to enhance your experience. This data remains
        on your device and is not transmitted to our servers. Specifically, we
        store the following information in your browser's
        <code>localStorage</code>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Last.fm Username:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> To prefill the username input field when
              you revisit the application, saving you from re-entering it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scope:</strong> Only the last successfully used username
              is stored.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Storage:</strong> Stored exclusively on your device in
              your browser; not sent to our servers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Theme Preference:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> To remember your preferred viewing theme
              (e.g., light or dark mode) for subsequent visits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Storage:</strong> Stored exclusively on your device in
              your browser; not sent to our servers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interaction with Third-Party Services</h2>
      <h3>Last.fm</h3>
      <p>
        Our application uses the Last.fm username you provide to request your
        top album data for a selected time period directly from Last.fm's
        servers. We do not store your Last.fm username persistently on our
        servers beyond what is necessary for caching.
      </p>
      <p>
        To improve performance and reduce the load on the Last.fm API, we cache
        the responses we receive from Last.fm. This cached data includes album
        details for your charts.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Successful responses:</strong> Cached for up to 1 hour. This
          means if you request the same chart for the same username and time
          period within this window, you may receive a faster response from our
          cache.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>"Not found" or empty results:</strong> Cached for up to 10
          minutes. This helps avoid repeated requests for data that is unlikely
          to appear quickly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cache Key:</strong> The cache is keyed using a combination of
          your Last.fm username and the selected time period. This ensures that
          the cached data is specific to your request.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We encourage you to review
        <a
          href="https://www.last.fm/legal/privacy"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Last.fm's privacy policy</a
        >
        to understand how they handle your data.
      </p>

      <h3>Spotify Album Links</h3>
      <p>
        Our application can fetch and display links to albums on Spotify. When
        you request a Spotify link for a specific album, the application sends
        the album name and artist name you provide to our server. Our server
        then uses this information to query the Spotify API to find the relevant
        album link.
      </p>
      <p>
        To improve performance and reduce the number of API calls to Spotify, we
        cache the results of these lookups on our server.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Cached:</strong> The cache stores the provided album name
          and artist name along with the corresponding Spotify link if found, or
          a "not found" status. No personal user data is included in this cache.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cache Key:</strong> The cache is keyed using a combination of
          the album name and artist name to ensure specificity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Successful lookups:</strong> Cached for up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>"Not found" status:</strong> Cached for up to 1 hour.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The use of the Spotify API is subject to
        <a
          href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Spotify's Privacy Policy</a
        >. We encourage you to review their policy to understand how Spotify
        handles your information.
      </p>

      <h2>Share Your Grid</h2>
      <p>
        Our application allows you to generate a unique link to share your
        created album grid with others. When you choose to share a grid, the
        following information is stored on our servers to make this feature
        possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Last.fm username used to generate the grid.</li>
        <li>The time period selected for the grid (e.g., 7-day, 1-month).</li>
        <li>
          The list of albums (including artist name, album name, and album cover
          image URL) that constitute the grid.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is stored on our servers for
        <strong>30 days</strong> from the date you share the grid. After this
        period, the shared grid data and its unique link may be automatically
        deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please be aware that anyone with whom you share the unique link will be
        able to view the generated grid, which includes the Last.fm username,
        the selected time period, and the album details. You are responsible for
        deciding with whom you share these links.
      </p>

      <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics to collect information about your use of our
        application. This information helps us understand how users engage with
        our site and allows us to improve your experience.
      </p>
      <p>Google Analytics may collect data such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages you visit on our site</li>
        <li>Time spent on those pages</li>
        <li>Interactions with site elements (e.g., button clicks)</li>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system</li>
        <li>Referring URLs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is aggregated and anonymized by Google Analytics, and we do
        not use it to personally identify you. The information collected is used
        solely for statistical analysis and to enhance the functionality and
        user experience of our application.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information on how Google Analytics collects and processes
        data, please visit Google's Privacy Policy:
        <a
          href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >https://policies.google.com/privacy</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We prioritize your privacy and aim to minimize the data we store. We do
        not store direct personal identifiers such as IP addresses or detailed
        raw server access logs related to your individual requests, apart from
        what is collected by Google Analytics as described in its own section.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as detailed in other sections of this policy, certain data is
        temporarily stored on our servers to enable specific application
        functionalities. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cached API responses from Last.fm and Spotify (containing album and
          artist information, usernames for Last.fm, and time periods) to
          improve performance and reduce external API calls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data for the "Share Your Grid" feature (Last.fm username, selected
          time period, and album list) to allow shared grids to be viewed via a
          unique link.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This storage is implemented for the specific, disclosed purposes of
        enhancing application performance and enabling sharing features. We take
        reasonable technical and administrative measures to protect the
        information that we do temporarily store on our servers. However, no
        method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage
        is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
