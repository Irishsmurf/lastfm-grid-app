      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: June 11, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Paddez.com ("we", "us", or "our")
        handles information in connection with your use of our application.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect or store any personal data from our users. Our
        application does not use cookies or any other tracking technologies to
        gather information about you.
      </p>

      <h2>Client-Side Storage</h2>
      <p>
        For your convenience, our application utilizes the browser's
        <code>localStorage</code> to enhance your experience. Specifically, we
        store the last successfully used username directly in your browser.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> This is solely to prefill the username input
          field when you revisit the application, saving you from having to
          re-enter it each time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Locally Stored:</strong> This information is stored only on
          your computer within your web browser's local storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Transmission:</strong> The username stored in
          <code>localStorage</code> is not transmitted to our servers or any
          third-party services. It remains local to your browser session.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Theme Preferences:</strong> To allow you to customize your
          viewing experience, we store your preferred theme (e.g., light or dark
          mode) in your browser's <code>localStorage</code>. The default storage
          key for this preference is 'vite-ui-theme'. This information is stored
          locally in your browser and is not transmitted to our servers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interaction with Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our application interacts with Last.fm. When you use our application to
        access Last.fm services, any username or other information you provide
        for this purpose is sent directly to Last.fm's servers. We do not store
        this information on our servers. We encourage you to review Last.fm's
        privacy policy to understand how they handle your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Spotify Album Links</h2>
      <p>
        Our application can fetch links to albums on Spotify. When you request a
        Spotify link for an album, the application sends the album name and
        artist name you provide to our server. Our server then uses this
        information to query the Spotify API to find the relevant album link.
      </p>
      <p>
        To improve performance and reduce the number of requests to Spotify, we
        cache the results of these lookups. If an album link is found, it is
        stored on our server for up to 24 hours. If an album is not found on
        Spotify, this "not found" status is cached for up to 1 hour. This cache
        only contains the album and artist name and the corresponding Spotify
        link (or not-found status); it does not include any personal user data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of the Spotify API is subject to
        <a
          href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Spotify's Privacy Policy</a
        >. We encourage you to review their policy to understand how Spotify
        handles your information.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We do not store any data related to your requests, such as IP addresses
        or usage logs.
      </p>
